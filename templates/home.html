    <h2>About my self </h2>
    <p>Greetings, I'm Chakradhar Reddy Thera, an adaptable professional originally from India and now residing in Dresden since 2020. My academic journey has been diverse, starting with a bachelor's degree in electronics and communications engineering. During this time, I delved into internships in telecommunications at BSNL and manufacturing at BHEL, gaining insights into networking, databanks, and PLCs within CNC machines. Eager to broaden my skill set, I ventured into frontend development at Infiziant, mastering HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Continuing my quest for knowledge, I recently completed a master's degree in environmental engineering, alongside working as a DevOps trainee at CGI. Here, I immersed myself in DevOps practices and agile methodologies, honing my expertise in technologies like Git, GitHub, Azure DevOps, Docker, Flask, and Terraform. With certifications including AWS Cloud Practitioner, AZ-900, AZ-104, and Terraform Associate, I'm enthusiastic about making impactful contributions in cloud engineering and DevOps, driven by a passion for continuous learning and innovation.</p>
